  You know the rules and so do I
  A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
  You wouldn't get this from any other guy
  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
  Gotta make you understand
  Never gonna give you up
  Never gonna let you down
  Never gonna run around and desert you
  Never gonna make you cry
  Never gonna say goodbye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
  We've known each other for so long
  Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
  Inside we both know what's been going on
  We know the game and we're gonna play it
  And if you ask me how I'm feeling
  Don't tell me you're too blind to see
  Never gonna give you up
  Never gonna let you down
  Never gonna run around and desert you
  Never gonna make you cry
  Never gonna say goodbye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
  Never gonna give you up
  Never gonna let you down
  Never gonna run around and desert you
  Never gonna make you cry
  Never gonna say goodbye
  Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
  Never gonna give, never gonna give
  (Give you up)
  (Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give
